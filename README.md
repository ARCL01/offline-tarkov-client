# offline-tarkov-client
Client for connecting to fika SPT server through tailscale services

## Notice
This is just a temporary readme, so you can get the script up and running in a minute. I hope I will convince myself to make this documentation one day.

## Quick guide
1. Download the latest release
2. Unzip the folder
3. Since this script is not digitally signed and Microsoft doesn't like that you will need to run this ```Set-ExecutionPolicy unrestricted``` PowerShell command as **an administrator** in the folder where the ```run.ps1``` file is located.\
4. Open up PowerShell and type ```.\run```
5. That's it, you can now follow the output of the script
