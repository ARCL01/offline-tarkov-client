# offline-tarkov-client
Client for connecting to fika SPT server through tailscale services

## Notice
This is just a temporary readme, so you can get the script up and running in a minute. I hope I will convince myself to make this documentation one day.

## Quick guide
1. If you have not already done that, install latest release of SPT
2. Download the latest release
3. Unzip the folder
4. Since this script is not digitally signed and Microsoft doesn't like that you will need to run this ```Set-ExecutionPolicy unrestricted``` PowerShell command as **an administrator** in the folder where the ```run.ps1``` file is located.\
5. Open up PowerShell and type ```.\run```
6. That's it, you can now follow the output of the script
